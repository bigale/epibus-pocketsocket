# Industrial Temperature Monitoring Flow

This Node-RED flow implements a robust temperature monitoring system designed by **Kyoko Kirigiri** for industrial reactor control. The flow combines her analytical precision with practical industrial automation needs.

## Flow Overview

The temperature monitoring flow demonstrates several key industrial IoT concepts:

- **Real-time Data Acquisition**: Continuous polling of Modbus temperature sensors
- **Data Processing**: Calibration and validation of sensor readings
- **Intelligent Alarming**: Multi-level threshold monitoring with automated responses
- **Data Persistence**: Historical logging for trend analysis and compliance
- **Visualization**: Real-time dashboards for operators

## Character Implementation Notes

As befitting Kyoko's methodical nature, this flow prioritizes:

- **Accuracy**: Multiple validation steps ensure data integrity
- **Reliability**: Error handling and failover mechanisms
- **Analysis**: Historical data collection for pattern recognition
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive logging of all events

## Technical Details

### Modbus Configuration
```javascript
// Temperature sensor configuration
const sensorConfig = {
    server: "192.168.1.100",
    port: 502,
    register: 100,
    dataType: "int16",
    scaling: 0.1
};
```

### Alarm Logic
The flow implements a three-tier alarm system:

1. **Normal Operation** (20-80째C): Green status, regular logging
2. **Warning Level** (80-90째C): Yellow status, increased monitoring
3. **Critical Level** (>90째C): Red status, immediate operator notification

### Data Processing Function
```javascript
// Temperature calibration and validation
const processTemperature = (rawValue) => {
    // Apply calibration offset
    let temp = rawValue * 0.1 - 2.0;
    
    // Validate reading
    if (temp < -50 || temp > 200) {
        throw new Error("Temperature reading out of valid range");
    }
    
    return {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        temperature: temp,
        unit: "째C",
        quality: "good",
        source: "reactor-001"
    };
};
```

## Installation and Usage

1. **Import the Flow**: Copy the flow JSON from the examples directory
2. **Configure Modbus**: Update the Modbus server settings for your environment
3. **Set Database Path**: Configure the SQLite database location
4. **Deploy**: Deploy the flow and verify connections
5. **Monitor**: Access the dashboard at `/ui` to view real-time data

## Dashboard Features

The temperature monitoring dashboard includes:

- **Real-time Temperature Chart**: Live trend display with configurable time ranges
- **Current Status**: Large display showing current temperature and status
- **Alarm History**: List of recent alarms with timestamps and severity
- **System Health**: Connection status and data quality indicators

## Integration with AI-Kit

This flow integrates seamlessly with the AI-Kit character system:

- **Character Context**: Kyoko's analytical personality influences alarm sensitivity
- **Theme Integration**: UI colors and styling match Kyoko's purple theme
- **Behavior Patterns**: Error handling reflects Kyoko's methodical approach
- **Documentation Style**: Technical precision with detective-like attention to detail

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Errors**: Verify Modbus server IP and port configuration
**Data Quality Issues**: Check sensor wiring and calibration settings
**Missing Data**: Ensure database permissions and disk space
**UI Not Loading**: Verify Node-RED dashboard is properly configured

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by uncommenting the debug nodes in the flow. This provides detailed logging of:

- Raw Modbus readings
- Processed temperature values
- Alarm trigger events
- Database write operations
