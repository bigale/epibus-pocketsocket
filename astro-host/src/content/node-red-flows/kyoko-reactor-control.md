# Kyoko's Industrial Process Control Flow

This advanced Node-RED flow represents Kyoko's analytical approach to industrial automation, focusing on precise monitoring and control of critical reactor operations.

## Overview

As the Ultimate Detective, Kyoko brings her methodical investigation skills to industrial process control. This flow implements a comprehensive monitoring system that can detect anomalies before they become critical issues.

## Key Features

### üîç **Detective-Level Monitoring**
- **Temperature Analysis**: Continuous monitoring with trend analysis to predict equipment failures
- **Pressure Investigation**: Multi-point pressure monitoring with correlation analysis
- **Flow Rate Detection**: Precise flow measurements with leak detection algorithms

### ‚ö° **Automated Control Systems**
- **Predictive Adjustments**: Machine learning-based parameter optimization
- **Safety Interlocks**: Multi-layered safety systems with redundant checking
- **Emergency Response**: Automated shutdown procedures for critical situations

### üìä **Data Collection & Analysis**
- **Historical Trending**: Long-term data storage for pattern analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Real-time statistical process control
- **Report Generation**: Automated shift reports and compliance documentation

## Implementation Details

### MODBUS Configuration
```javascript
// Reactor PLC Connection
const modbusConfig = {
    server: "192.168.1.100",
    port: 5020,
    unitId: 1,
    registers: {
        temperature: 100,
        pressure: 101, 
        flowRate: 102,
        controlValve: 200
    }
};
```

### Safety Logic
The safety interlock system implements Kyoko's methodical approach:

1. **Primary Checks**: Continuous monitoring of critical parameters
2. **Secondary Verification**: Cross-reference multiple sensors
3. **Tertiary Confirmation**: Operator acknowledgment for manual overrides
4. **Emergency Action**: Immediate shutdown if all checks fail

### Dashboard Interface
The operator interface reflects Kyoko's preference for clear, organized information:

- **Status Overview**: Color-coded system health indicators
- **Trend Charts**: Real-time and historical data visualization  
- **Alarm Management**: Prioritized alert system with investigation tools
- **Control Panels**: Secure manual override capabilities

## Character Integration

This flow embodies Kyoko's investigative methodology:

- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: All control actions are logged with reasoning
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced analytics to identify subtle trends
- **Methodical Approach**: Systematic checking and verification procedures
- **Truth Seeking**: Transparent logging and audit trails

## Usage Instructions

1. **Initial Setup**: Import flow and configure MODBUS connection parameters
2. **Calibration**: Run calibration procedure for all sensors
3. **Testing**: Execute full system test including emergency scenarios
4. **Production**: Enable automatic mode with operator oversight

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and Kyoko's investigative approach to solving them:

- **Communication Errors**: Check network connectivity and MODBUS configuration
- **Sensor Drift**: Verify calibration and replace sensors if necessary
- **Control Loop Instability**: Tune PID parameters and check for mechanical issues
- **Dashboard Issues**: Clear browser cache and verify WebSocket connections

## Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 100ms for critical alarms
- **Accuracy**: ¬±0.1% for temperature, ¬±0.5% for pressure
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Data Retention**: 1 year of historical data
