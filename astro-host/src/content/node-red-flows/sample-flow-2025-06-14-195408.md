# Auto-Generated Sample Flow

This flow was automatically generated at **Sat Jun 14 19:54:08 EDT 2025** for demonstration purposes.

## Purpose

This sample demonstrates how content collections can be automatically populated with real-time data from the Node-RED simulators.

## Features

- **Auto-Generation**: Created by the content generator script
- **Real-Time**: Generated at Sat Jun 14 19:54:08 EDT 2025
- **Character Context**: Associated with **celestia** simulator
- **Dynamic**: Changes each time the generator runs

## Generated Configuration

```javascript
const config = {
    character: "celestia",
    timestamp: "2025-06-14T19:54:08-04:00",
    random: 4325
};
```
