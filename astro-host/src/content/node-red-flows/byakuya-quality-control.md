# Quality Control Automation System

This premium quality control system embodies **Byakuya Togami's** uncompromising standards for excellence. Every component has been meticulously designed to ensure only products meeting the highest standards proceed through the manufacturing line.

## System Philosophy

> "Mediocrity is the enemy of excellence. This system accepts nothing less than perfection." - Byakuya Togami

The quality control flow implements enterprise-grade statistical process control with the sophistication expected in world-class manufacturing facilities.

## Advanced Features

### Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- **Real-time Control Charts**: X-bar and R charts with automatic limit calculation
- **Trend Analysis**: Machine learning-enhanced pattern recognition
- **Capability Studies**: Cp, Cpk, and Pp calculations
- **SPC Violations**: Automatic detection of statistical anomalies

### Vision System Integration
```javascript
// Premium vision inspection interface
const inspectionConfig = {
    apiEndpoint: "http://192.168.1.200:8080/inspect",
    imageResolution: "4K",
    inspectionTypes: [
        "dimensional_accuracy",
        "surface_defects", 
        "color_matching",
        "assembly_completeness"
    ],
    accuracy: "99.7%",
    throughput: "120_parts_per_minute"
};
```

### Quality Classification Matrix

| Grade | Criteria | Action | Byakuya's Standard |
|-------|----------|--------|--------------------|
| **Excellent** | ≥98.5% | Premium Line | "Acceptable for the Togami name" |
| **Acceptable** | ≥95.0% | Standard Line | "Meets commercial requirements" |
| **Marginal** | ≥90.0% | Secondary Market | "Below our usual standards" |
| **Reject** | <90.0% | Automatic Rejection | "Unworthy of consideration" |

## Implementation Details

### SPC Algorithm
```javascript
// Statistical Process Control implementation
const calculateSPC = (measurements) => {
    const mean = measurements.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / measurements.length;
    const range = Math.max(...measurements) - Math.min(...measurements);
    const stdDev = Math.sqrt(measurements.reduce((sq, n) => 
        sq + Math.pow(n - mean, 2), 0) / (measurements.length - 1));
    
    return {
        mean: mean,
        range: range,
        standardDeviation: stdDev,
        upperControlLimit: mean + (3 * stdDev),
        lowerControlLimit: mean - (3 * stdDev),
        cpk: calculateCpk(mean, stdDev, specifications),
        trend: detectTrend(measurements),
        recommendation: generateRecommendation(mean, stdDev)
    };
};
```

### Rejection Control Logic
```javascript
// Precision timing for rejection mechanism
const controlRejection = (qualityScore, position) => {
    if (qualityScore < thresholds.marginal) {
        // Calculate precise timing for pneumatic actuator
        const conveyorSpeed = 2.5; // meters/second
        const rejectionDistance = 0.8; // meters from sensor
        const delay = (rejectionDistance / conveyorSpeed) * 1000;
        
        setTimeout(() => {
            actuatePneumaticRejection();
            logRejection(qualityScore, position, Date.now());
        }, delay);
    }
};
```
