### Real-Time Status Dashboard
```
📊 System Status Dashboard
==========================
🏭 Main Dashboard (4321): ❌ Offline
🕵️ Kyoko (1881/5020): ✅ Online
💼 Byakuya (1882/5021): ❌ Offline
💻 Chihiro (1883/5022): ❌ Offline
🎨 Celestia (1884/5023): ❌ Offline
💪 Sakura (1885/5024): ❌ Offline

💾 System Resources:
   Memory: 16Gi / 24Gi
   Node.js processes: 9
   Browser processes: 34
```

### Cross-Platform Window Management Integration
- **Windows**: Integrates with PowerShell virtual desktop scripts
- **WSL2/Linux**: Integrates with browser grid management
- **Universal**: Browser cleanup and process monitoring

### Intelligent Tool Dispatch
- Automatically calls the right script based on platform
- Maintains all existing functionality while providing unified interface
- Handles fallbacks when platform-specific tools aren't available

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Platform Detection ✅
```bash
$ ./ai-kit-admin.sh --platform
Platform: wsl2
Project: /home/bigale/repos/epibus-pocketsocket
```

### Status Monitoring ✅
```bash
$ ./ai-kit-admin.sh --status
📊 System Status Dashboard
==========================
🏭 Main Dashboard (4321): ❌ Offline
🕵️ Kyoko (1881/5020): ✅ Online
💼 Byakuya (1882/5021): ❌ Offline
# ... (shows real-time service status)
```

### Help System ✅
- Complete help documentation integrated
- Command-line options working
- Interactive mode ready

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Scripts

### Scripts Now Integrated
1. **`launch-complete-system.sh`** → System Management menu
2. **`setup.sh`** → System Management menu
