# 🐚 Shell Compatibility Fix - Test Script Rename

## Issue Identified
The test script was originally named `test.sh`, which can cause conflicts with the shell builtin `test` command. This is a common issue that can lead to unexpected behavior when users try to run shell conditional tests.

## Solution Implemented
✅ Renamed `test.sh` to `validate.sh` in both:
- `/home/bigale/repos/docs-organizer/validate.sh` (standalone repository)
- `/home/bigale/repos/epibus-pocketsocket/tools/docs-organizer/validate.sh` (integrated copy)

## Benefits
- **🔒 No Shell Conflicts**: The `test` builtin command remains fully functional
- **📝 Clear Naming**: `validate.sh` more clearly describes what the script does
- **✅ Best Practice**: Follows shell scripting best practices for naming
- **🔄 Backward Compatibility**: All functionality remains identical

## Verification
- ✅ Shell builtin `test` command works: `test 1 -eq 1`
- ✅ Validation script works: `./validate.sh` passes all tests
- ✅ Documentation organizer functions normally
- ✅ Git history preserved with proper rename tracking

## Related Files Updated
- Git commits in both repositories track the file rename
- All functionality and test coverage remains intact
- No documentation references needed updating (already used `validate.sh`)

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Shell compatibility ensured, no functional changes
